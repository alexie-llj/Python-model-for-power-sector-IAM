# Python-model-for-power-sector-IAM
**PowerSectorIAM** PowerSectorIAM is a Python-based Integrated Assessment Model tailored for the power sector, with the following key features:

Multi-region, Multi-technology – Models regions like EU, US, China and technologies including solar PV, wind, coal, gas CCGT, nuclear, and hydro.

LCOE Calculation – Computes levelized cost of electricity considering investment, O&M, fuel, and carbon costs.

Capacity Expansion & Investment Allocation – Allocates investment based on demand growth and technology competitiveness, respecting maximum potential limits.

Policy Scenario Analysis – Simulates carbon pricing, renewable subsidies, and policy uncertainties on costs and investment.

Learning & Spillover Effects – Applies technology learning curves and regional/technology spillovers to update costs dynamically.

Monte Carlo Simulation & Uncertainty Analysis – Captures parameter uncertainty to generate probabilistic outcomes for costs, capacity, generation, and renewable tipping points.

Renewable Energy Tipping Point Analysis – Identifies when renewable share exceeds thresholds and provides regional trajectories.

Visualization & Analysis – Supports time-series plots, confidence intervals, boxplots, and other visual summaries for academic presentations.
